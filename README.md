# Flight-Price-Prediction-System

## About
The purpose of this project is to create a Minimal Viable Product of forecasting flight prices. We will use Kaggle Flight Price's Flight Price Dataset, which has 10683 records that explain the flight details from India fromÂ 2019. Data Augmentation techniques were then used to create a proof of concept to cater to the American Airlines scenario. Machine learning techniques to evaluate this dataset in order to forecast the price of an airline ticket based on the features supplied in the dataset's columns have been used. In addition, an app has been created to allow users to interact with the model using Flask.

Cleaning the dataset, feature engineering, dataset splitting, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning are all steps in the Data Science Life Cycle that will be used to process the data.
 
## Models and Algorithms
Algorithms used:
1)Random Forest
2)Extra Trees Regressor

The regression evaluation metrics RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R2 Score (Coefficient of Determination) were utilized because the target variable is a continuous variable.
